Represent 17 in unsigned binary.

17 / 2 = 8 r 1
8 / 2 = 4 r 0
4 / 2 = 2 r 0
2 / 2 = 1 r 0
1 / 2 = 0 r 1

10001

Signed Magnitude Notation:
Most significant bit is:
    0 if (+)
    1 if (-)

Ex w/4 bits:
0010 = +2
1010 = -2


One's Compliment Notation:
Idea: Flip the bits to negate
Ex: w/4 bits
    0101 -> +5
    1010 -> -5

Two's Compliment Notation:
Idea: Flip the bits, then add one to negate
Ex: w/8 bits
    0000 0101 = 5
    1111 1011 = -5


Limits on Quantities:
    
    With Four Bits:
        Max Value = 2 ^ (4-1) - 1 = 7
        Min Value = -2 ^ (4-1) = -8

    With Eight Bits:
        Max value = 2 ^ (8-1) - 1 = 127
        Min value = 2 ^ (8 - 1) = -128

    With n Bits:
        Max = 2 ^ (n - 1) -1
        Min = -2 ^ (n - 1)
        
Overflow occurs when you exceed the max or min value when performing operations.
