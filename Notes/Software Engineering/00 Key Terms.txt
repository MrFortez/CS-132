The Software Lifecycle - a model of how software is developed,
    used, maintained, and dies.

CRC Cards - Class, Responsibilities, Collaborator Cards.
    a tool/strategy to capture the classes (nouns),
    their Responsibilities (verbs),
    and their collaborators (other classes)


Documentation - The What and Why of the Code
    frequently takes the form of comments in your Code
    
Prototyping - the process of generating a preliminary model
    of an application or creating an early version to test

Iterative Development - the process of implementing the basic
    functionality, testing it, implementing a little more, testing that,
    builidng on top of that funcitonality, and testing, and so on.

Testing - searching for the presence of errors.

Regression Testing - the process of running tests to see if anything that was previously
    working is now broken. The bit of code that is not working anymore is called 
    a Regression.
    
Debugging - the process of finding the source of an errors.

Rubber Duck Debugging - debugging by describing what is happening in your code to a
    rubber duck (or jsut describing the code out loud).

Profiling - the process of fixing performance issues in code.
    Typically done using a tool (a profiler)

Refactoring - the process of modifying code without introducing new features.'
    Typically done to make code more maintainable, more readable, fewer lines, etc.
    (focusing on cohesion and coupling)

Sanitizing Input - ensuring input is of the proper data type, in the proper range of values,
    making sure it's valid in any way before it.`
