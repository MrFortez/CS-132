04 Shoot The Spider
This is a heavily altered variation on the basic shoot the spider concept based on the 
Nightmare Power Orb Boss Fight from Kirby's Adventure on the NES. 

Video of the fight:

You control kirby, and you can move in all four directions using the arrowkeys.
You can also fire a star projectile using SPACEBAR, with a half-second cooldown.
Kirby has 10 hp, displayed by a health bar on the top-left corner of the screen

The enemy is the Nightmare Power Orb. It's attack cycle is based on the time since the game started, cycling to
the next phase every 10 seconds. Once Nightmare has reached half health, he will become enraged, making
all of his attacks far more difficult.

Also the music playing is "It Has To Be This Way" because I thought it'd be funny

In Phase 1: Nightmare will move up and down the screen and fire a single star projectile horizontally
towards kirby every half second. If enraged, he'll fire two more star projectiles, one above and one below
the original shot.

In Phase 2: Nighmare will teleport to 5 different posisitions on the right side of the screen and
fire two star projectiles. If enraged, he'll teleport twice as fast.

In Phase 3: Nightmare will alternate between two attacks. First he will follow Kirby vertically,
firing a single star projectile horizontally in a very similar manner to Phase 1. Every few seconds,
he will stop firing shots and dash towards kirby, dealing contact damage if he hits kirby, before returning
to firing shots. If enraged, he will again fire two more projectiles, and he also dashes
more often and faster.

In Phase 4: Nightmare will teleport near the top right of the screen and slowly move down, rapidly
firing projectiles horizontally. Once he reaches a bit below the middle of the screen, he teleports
to the bottom of the screen, slowly moving up and firing more projectiles. It will then repeat this process. 
If enraged, Nightmare will move further before teleporting and changing direction, making the opening to avoid
the projectiles smaller.

In Phase 5: Nightmare will teleport to the center of the screen and rapidly fire two sets of projectiles 
at opposite angles in a circular motion. If enraged, he will fire two more bands of projectiles, those at 
90 degree offsets from the original 2 bands.

In Phase 6: Nightmare will circle the outer edges of the screen, occasionally firing projectiles 
towards the center of the screen. If enraged, he will fire twice as many projectiles.

After a minute has passed, the cycle will repeat. 

The game will end if either the user closes the window or presses esc. 
Additionally, the game will end if either Kirby or Nightmare reaches 0 hp.
If Kirby reaches 0 hp, you Lose...
If Nightmare reaches 0 hp, you Win!

Good Luck!
